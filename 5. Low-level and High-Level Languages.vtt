00:00.030 --> 00:06.900
So in the previous video I have already explained you that we talk or we understand natural

1
00:06.900 --> 00:13.440
language human beings and machines have their machine language and that language is in binary that is

2
00:13.440 --> 00:14.550
zeros and ones.

3
00:14.580 --> 00:14.940
Right.

4
00:15.090 --> 00:17.300
So it is in the form of zero & ones.

5
00:17.300 --> 00:24.270
we say this is binary language. binary language we can call it does machine language, machine

6
00:24.270 --> 00:25.350
language.

7
00:25.350 --> 00:32.910
So that is termed as low level language, low level language. machine language is low level. low level

8
00:32.910 --> 00:35.610
means actual machine's language we can't understand it.

9
00:36.570 --> 00:41.370
So when the machines were introduced initially it was very difficult for people to write the program

10
00:41.380 --> 00:42.300
so it was not common.

11
00:42.300 --> 00:44.290
Machines were used in laboratories.

12
00:44.400 --> 00:48.500
It was not used by masses or it was not available at consumer level.

13
00:49.100 --> 00:54.720
So at that time so the people who develop they used to learn something from this machine code and they

14
00:54.720 --> 00:59.890
used for everything in machine code form that was very tough and it was very initial stage and then

15
00:59.900 --> 01:04.680
later they thought like there should be some attempt to make it easy so they introduce some language

16
01:04.680 --> 01:08.230
called assembly language, assembly language.

17
01:08.640 --> 01:13.200
So this assembly language was a little easier than binary right.

18
01:13.230 --> 01:18.900
So this is nobody can think of working on it, except the one who has to manufacture the machine. Now assembly

19
01:18.900 --> 01:20.520
language it was little easy.

20
01:20.520 --> 01:25.630
It can be taught and it can be learned and it can be practiced and used for writing the program.

21
01:25.890 --> 01:29.710
So this was a use for some time right.

22
01:29.760 --> 01:34.500
And this became a base for conversion from this language to machine language.

23
01:34.590 --> 01:40.050
So still that is also low level language it's very difficult for learning if suppose a class of 100

24
01:40.070 --> 01:46.050
student and if somebody is teaching assembly language then there's the chances of learning one student

25
01:46.050 --> 01:47.330
learning it right.

26
01:47.550 --> 01:50.930
So the learning curve is very high and it's very difficult.

27
01:51.180 --> 01:56.720
Like other parts of academic students learn it for some time and they finish the exam and forget it.

28
01:56.730 --> 02:03.670
So anyway we don't have to use it if at all you want to work in systems programming that you want the

29
02:03.670 --> 02:08.480
right operating system level programs and on then you need to learn about it right.

30
02:08.840 --> 02:14.130
So I'll give you idea on that one where this assembly  language is useful if if at all you needed

31
02:14.760 --> 02:17.720
then this is also low level so under low level.

32
02:17.790 --> 02:25.590
We have two languages, under a low level that is machine language and assembly language machine language

33
02:25.650 --> 02:26.730
and assembly language.

34
02:26.730 --> 02:31.300
In short I'm writing. As this was also difficult.

35
02:31.350 --> 02:38.400
We wanted some English like language so English like languages are high level languages they are not

36
02:38.400 --> 02:42.350
exactly like English and they are not more like machine code right.

37
02:42.630 --> 02:44.060
So they are in-between.

38
02:44.070 --> 02:51.270
So that is easy for easy enough for anybody to learn so that are high level languages.

39
02:51.270 --> 02:57.360
So there are a  n no. of of high level languages lots of high level lang. are out there like present day

40
02:57.360 --> 03:00.090
we are using language like i will name them.

41
03:00.090 --> 03:14.790
So these are easy to learn right high level languages C C++ Java Python C sharp visual basic Visual

42
03:14.790 --> 03:18.460
C++ and the list goes on.

43
03:18.450 --> 03:20.260
There are various languages.

44
03:20.670 --> 03:20.970
Right.

45
03:21.330 --> 03:26.460
So these languages we call them as programming languages because we can program and we humans

46
03:26.460 --> 03:27.530
can program them.

47
03:27.570 --> 03:32.610
Actually this assembly language is also programming language that is low level programming language

48
03:32.940 --> 03:34.410
and these are high level language.

49
03:35.070 --> 03:37.290
So we are much familiar with this language.

50
03:37.320 --> 03:39.090
So these are really easy to learn.

51
03:39.340 --> 03:45.270
No doubt for a beginner it is tough in the beginning but when you are used to learn when you learn any

52
03:45.270 --> 03:50.940
one of the languages sufficient you can learn all of the languages you should learn one language thoroughly

53
03:51.270 --> 03:56.940
then you can understand all other languages they are on the same patterns now.

54
03:57.090 --> 04:04.200
And one more thing about this these languages we can categorise them as compiler based languages and

55
04:04.200 --> 04:10.200
some are interpreter based languages and some are hybrid languages.

56
04:10.200 --> 04:11.730
What are these.

57
04:11.730 --> 04:12.990
We will understand next video.
